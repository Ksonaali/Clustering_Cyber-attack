# Clustering_Cyber-attack
This clustering consulting project aimed to identify the number of hackers involved in a cyber attack on a technology firm. Clustering analysis revealed that only two hackers were involved, with both conducting 167 activities each. This information helped the firm strengthen its security measures and prevent future attacks.

The objective of this clustering consulting project was to identify the number of hackers involved in a cyber attack on a large technology firm. The project was initiated after the firm's forensic engineer provided metadata about the sessions used by the hackers to connect to their servers. The metadata included various features such as session time, bytes transferred, Kali trace used, servers corrupted, pages corrupted, location, and WPM typing speed.

The firm suspected that three potential hackers might have been involved in the attack, and they wanted to confirm this suspicion. The forensic engineer also mentioned that the hackers traded off attacks, meaning that they should each have roughly the same amount of attacks. This information was crucial to solving the problem, but the engineer did not know how to distinguish this unlabeled data into groups of hackers.

To tackle this problem, clustering was performed on the given data. The objective was to form clusters that would help identify the number of hackers involved in the attack. The analysis revealed that the optimal number of clusters formed were two, which suggested that only two hackers were involved in the hack. Additionally, it was confirmed that both hackers were involved in 167 activities each.

Overall, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering in identifying the number of hackers involved in a cyber attack. The findings were crucial for the technology firm to strengthen their security measures and prevent similar attacks in the future.
